created polling app where user after authenticating can make polls vote in polls and see results ,
due to power failure in our area and limited time i am not able to make it real time ,sorry for that but i tried to make application as functional as possible.

how to use  :

first authenticate ;
you will land on page where use can see ten latest polls;
profile page you can see your name , email , your created polls and polls which you voted in
you can create poll by clicking create poll in navbar
you can also see result of polls you have created and voted in
